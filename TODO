CRUD operations:

PURCHASES:

	register_purchase()
	add_purchase_item(purchaseId)
	update_stock(shopId, purchaseId)


	// how do we lock purchaseId so noone can add items to it? All in one commit?,
	// e.g. Press button = register_purchase, Press cancel = delete purchase
	//		Scan item - add to purchaseItem, or delete it otherwise
	// flow: register_purchase -> N x add_purchase_item -> update_stock (and check constraints, non-negative stockItems and so on)


EMPLOYEES:

	add_employee( /* all their data, except (auto-generated) Id */ )
	hire_employee( employeeId )
	fire_employee_from_job( jobId )
	fire_employee( employeeId ) // the same but fire them from EVERY job
